Basic types in TS:

Type    --> Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has
Value   --> Is anything that we can assign to a variable


Primitive_Type:    number, string, boolean, symbol, void, null, undefined
Object_Type:       functions, classes, arrays, objects


Types are used by the TS compiler to analyze our code for errors.
Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase.
